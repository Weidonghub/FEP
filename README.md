Currently, only the AE_AWGN_2subs.py script (including training and testing) is provided. This code performs simulations of bit-wise FEP modulation for the sequence s = (s1, s2), with k1 = 2 and k2 = 4, over an AWGN channel.  
Simulation codes for additional scenarios and configurations will be released once the related article has been accepted.
